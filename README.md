This repository contains all the tasks I did in the Codsoft C++ Programming internship. 
I will post explanations for all the task codes here.

Task 1: Create a program that generates a random number and asks the
user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too
high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.
Explanation: This C++ program is a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user has three chances to guess that number correctly. If the user doesn't guess correctly within three tries, the program displays the correct number.
