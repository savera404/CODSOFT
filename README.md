This repository contains all the tasks I did in the Codsoft C++ Programming internship. 
I will post explanations for all the task codes here.

Task 1: Create a program that generates a random number and asks the
user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too
high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.
Explanation: This C++ program is a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user has three chances to guess that number correctly. If the user doesn't guess correctly within three tries, the program displays the correct number.

Task 2: Develop a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an
operation to perform.
Explanation: This C++ program is a simple calculator. It defines a template function called ArthOperation that takes two numbers and an operator as input. Inside this function, it uses a switch statement to perform basic arithmetic operations based on the provided operator ('+', '-', 'x', or '/'). If the operator is invalid or if the denominator is 0 during division, the program displays an error message and exits.
