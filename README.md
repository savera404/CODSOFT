This repository contains all the tasks I did in the Codsoft C++ Programming internship. 
I will post explanations for all the task codes here.

Task 1: Create a program that generates a random number and asks the
user to guess it. Provide feedback on whether the guess is too
high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.
Explanation: This C++ program is a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 10, and the user has three chances to guess that number correctly. If the user doesn't guess correctly within three tries, the program displays the correct number.

Task 2: Develop a calculator program that performs basic arithmetic
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. Allow the user to input two numbers and choose an
operation to perform.
Explanation: This C++ program is a simple calculator. It defines a template function called ArthOperation that takes two numbers and an operator as input. Inside this function, it uses a switch statement to perform basic arithmetic operations based on the provided operator ('+', '-', 'x', or '/'). If the operator is invalid or if the denominator is 0 during division, the program displays an error message and exits. 

Task 3: Build a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that
allows two players to play against each other
Explanation: This is a simple console based tic-tac-toe game that allows two users to play a game of tic-tac-toe. Users can choose the number of the slot they want to occupy. 
After the game ends (whether in a win or draw) players can choose to replay the game. 

Task 4: Build a simple console-based to-do list manager that allows users to add, view, and delete tasks.
Explanation: This C++ code defines a simple to-do list program with a menu-driven interface. It uses a std::map named to_do_list to store tasks and their corresponding status as key-value pairs. The user can add, or remove the tasks. They can update their status as well as display the tasks. In the main function, a menu is presented to the user with options to add tasks, display tasks, update task status, remove tasks, or quit the program. The user can choose an option by entering a corresponding number.
